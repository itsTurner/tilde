# Tilde
A simple programming language that uses its reduced syntax to transcend the linguistic restrictions imposed by the anglophilic origin of traditional programming languages' keywords. Created in an attempt to broaden the scope of anthropological languages represented in computer programming and to ease the use and education of programming in otherwise excluded communities. Compatible with alphabets under the UTF-8 standard.

File extensions officially follow one of three options, uniform with all other files in their project: `*.~`, `*.t`, or `*.tilde`
